Title       : Quote Through Pipe (LINUS Torvalds)
File        : pipe_quote.c
Author      : Monish Kumar.k
Description :
    This C program demonstrates inter-process communication using pipes.

    - It creates a unidirectional pipe using `pipe()`.
    - It writes a famous quote by Linus Torvalds to the write end of the pipe.
    - The same process reads the content from the read end of the pipe and
      writes it to standard output (STDOUT).
    - The program uses `getpid()` to print its process ID, and `getchar()` 
      is used to pause execution, allowing observation of the behavior.

    Quote Used:
        "Talk is cheap. Show me the code" â€” Linus Torvalds

Compilation :
    gcc pipe_quote.c -o pipe_quote

Execution :
    ./pipe_quote

Notes :
    - This program uses blocking `read()` and `write()` system calls.
    - Only one process is involved; no fork is used. It's a self-contained
      example of how pipes can be used within a single process.
    - Ensure proper buffer size is maintained while reading from the pipe.
